&lt;h1 id=&quot;event-code-of-conduct--anti-harassment-policy-2023&quot;&gt;Event Code of Conduct / Anti-Harassment Policy 2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event Code of Conduct applies to all virtual and in-person events. All attendees, participants, volunteers, organizers, speakers, partners, sponsors are required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect our community to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to respect the Code of Conduct outlined below. This code will be enforced throughout our events to ensure a safe environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any behavior that contravenes the spirit of Game Dev Happy Hour’s Code won’t be tolerated. We expect that everyone should show respect and courtesy to each other at our events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We prohibit any form of bullying, harassment, maltreatment, unreasonable discrimination on grounds of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ancestry, including colour and perceived race&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nationality or national origin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ethnic background or origin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;religion or creed, or religious belief, religious association, or religious activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;age&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sex, including sex-determined characteristics or circumstances, such as pregnancy, the possibility of pregnancy, or circumstances related to pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gender identity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marital or family status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;source of income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;political belief, political association, or political activity including publicly sympathizing with hate groups or endorsing political beliefs that contradict our values; deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of deadnames&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;physical or mental disability or related characteristics or circumstances, including reliance on a service animal, a wheelchair, or any other remedial appliance or device&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social disadvantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harassment of any form will not be tolerated at our events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-harassment&quot;&gt;What is harassment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harassment is abusive and unwelcome behaviour that degrades, demeans, humiliates, or embarrasses a person. It is a form of discrimination when it is based on one of the protected grounds (ancestry, sex, religion, etc, or other protected category mentioned above). The person experiencing the harassment may have informed the harasser the behaviour is unwelcome or the behaviour may be deemed unwelcome if a reasonable
person in those circumstances would view it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harassment includes but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offensive verbal behaviour
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;comments&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;innuendo&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jokes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;threats&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;deadnaming&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;misgendering,&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gestures and other non-verbal behaviour
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;touching or unnecessary physical contact&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;visual forms of harassment (posters, videos)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;physical behaviour (pushing, shoving)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;electronic harassment (emails, text messages, displaying graphic images)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sustained disruption of talks or other events&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;unwelcome sexual or physical/virtual attention, unwelcome sexual solicitations oradvances.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-if-harassed-or-witness-harassment&quot;&gt;What to do if harassed or witness harassment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you can, make it clear to the harasser that their behaviour is unwelcome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a record of the incident(s) including a description of unwanted behaviour, times, places, and witnesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyone who is asked to stop any harassing behavior, is expected to comply immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from an event with no refund and they may be banned from subsequent events and membership. The person who has been asked to leave due to harassment must do so immediately, quietly, and without drawing attention to themselves during the encounter and afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact the event organizers present at the event for assistance or report an incident anonymously here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-this-policy-important&quot;&gt;Why is this policy important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Theme Curtana has full Open Graph and Twitter Cards support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will look for the image in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page.thumbnail&lt;/code&gt; if defined in your post &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;front-matter field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If no specified &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page.thumbnail&lt;/code&gt; defined, it uses &lt;a href=&quot;/custom-heading-background.html&quot;&gt;Heading Background Image&lt;/a&gt; (aka. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page.heading-bg&lt;/code&gt;) if defined in your post front-matter field.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If no heading background image found, Curtana will try to grab the first image (wrapped inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) in your post as your post thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If nothing found, it falls back to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;logo.png&lt;/code&gt; located at your site root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page.thumb_force_logo&lt;/code&gt; in your post’s front-matter field to override the above lookup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To italicize text&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, like &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Langage&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the full phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citations, like &lt;cite&gt;— Tunghsiao Liu &amp;amp; Mark otto&lt;/cite&gt;, should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Deleted&lt;/del&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;inserted&lt;/ins&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superscript &lt;sup&gt;text&lt;/sup&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and subscript &lt;sub&gt;text&lt;/sub&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the exception of Nietzsche, no other madman has contributed so much to human sanity as has Louis Althusser. He is mentioned twice in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. There could be no greater lapse: for two important decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at the eye of all the important cultural storms. He fathered quite a few of them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize his work before suggesting a few (minor) modifications to it.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Society consists of practices: economic, political and ideological.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Althusser defines a practice as:&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“Any process of transformation of a determinate product, affected by a determinate human labour, using determinate means (of production)”
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The economic practice (the historically specific mode of production) transforms raw materials to finished products using human labour and other means of production, all organized within defined webs of inter-relations. The political practice does the same with social relations as the raw materials. Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way that a subject relates to his real life conditions of existence.
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;This is a rejection of the mechanistic worldview (replete with bases and superstructures). It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology. It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”. It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;“The objective internal reference … the system of questions commanding the answers given”&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Subjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.
                &lt;ul&gt;

These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;What happens in a pluralistic environment rich in competing ideologies?
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;Clarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                          &lt;li&gt;is the fact that in the new one, the second text is articulated with the lapses in the first text … (Marx measures) the problematic contained&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                      &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Ideology is a practice with lived and material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals, behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. The State employs Ideological Apparatuses (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices and productions: (organized) religion, the education system, the family, (organized) politics, the media, the industries of culture.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the Advertising and the film industries.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was alone then; when he sat in that same chair his wife now sits in, and I shared with him the positive result to his HIV test. Though he seemed disinterested, vaguely detached, he had obviously heard of HIV before. His chart from the local clinic indicated a previous history of and treatment for anal gonorrhea, two acute cases of syphilis in the past three years, and a urinary tract infection last month. His only listed sexual contact, his wife. Who, strangely enough, only tested positive for one of the syphilis infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mistake, this! I am married, not a giver of ass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giver of ass? That’s one for the archive, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unwilling to engage his obvious denials, I ignore the comment and instead explain that due to a higher than acceptable potential of a false positive result, we won’t consider his oral test as confirmatory until the more accurate blood analysis is in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I no understand”, he says to the room in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His annoyance is obvious. Abrasively, he offers me his exposed forearm. This, I assume, is my cue to draw his blood. Ignoring the indignant anger beginning to rise, I tighten my jaw, then swab the fat vein with betadine, working the cool, brown liquid off in concentric circles, using strong medicinal smelling alcohol. I use the betadine, as most of these men work in the mines, and dirt three layers thick on exposed skin is the norm. As the first tube in the vacationer fills with blood, he asks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So how I get this thing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, I see we are going to play the circuitous dance of ignorance. Sounding just a little too clinical, I begin the HIV 101 mantra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, people acquire HIV through certain types of sex with an infected person, through sharing needles with an infected person, and sometimes through a blood transfusion. Have you ever had a blood transfusion, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take the dismissive wave of his hand as a no to the transfusion question. I don’t make a great attempt to navigate a comfort zone here; instinct and experience telling me he has already set the script of what is to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She is fucking other cocks my whore devil wife”?
Bingo! A narrative that over the next six weeks I will hear from several other men as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These whores, all they want is the cock!”
Careful Skippy, you really aren’t as convincing as you think you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;zh-cn&quot;&gt;「名词成灾」的流行病里，灾情最严重的该是所谓「科学至上」（scientism）。在现代的工业社会里，科学早成显贵，科技更是骄子，所以知识分子的口头与笔下，有意无意，总爱用一些「学术化」的抽象名词，好显得客观而精确。有人称之为「伪术语」（pseudo-jargon）。例如：明明是 first step，却要说成 initial phase：明明是 letter，却要说成 communication，都属此类。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;『雪国』の主な舞台は、上越国境の清水トンネルを抜けた湯沢温泉であるが、この作品も『伊豆の踊子』同様に、川端康成の旅の出会いから生まれたもので、雪中の火事も実際に起ったことだと川端は語っている。川端は作品内で故意に地名を隠しているが、1934 年（昭和 9 年）6 月 13 日より 1937 年まで新潟県湯沢町の高半旅館（現：高半ホテル）に逗留していたことを随筆『「雪国」の旅』で述べている。&lt;/p&gt;
